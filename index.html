        Once upon a time there was a little boy named Josiah. He was not like all the other children,
        because he had a very big secret. Everyday he went to school hoping no one had discovered the truth.
        You see Josiah's parents were really Tomatos. How he turned out to be a normal boy, he didn't know.
        It was report card time, the trickiest time of the year, because that was when the teachers usually
        wanted to meet all of the students' parents. Josiah always did his best in school so that his
        parents wouldn't have to meet his teacher.
        
        This year was no exception, except that Hayley always wanted to meet everyone's parents. Sure
        enough, at the bottom of his report card, an interview time had been scheduled. Josiah was
        devastated! How would he explain?
        
        When he brought his report card home, his parents were excited. Finally they would get to meet one
        of Josiah's teachers.
        
        That evening Josiah and his parents walked to the school. All the while Josiah was dying inside.
        How, oh how, would he explain!? Hey, wait a minute! When he looked around he saw Louella, the most
        popular girl in class and her parents were Green beanses and walking towards the gym was Carter and
        his parents were Corns.
